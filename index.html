            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is cross platform, object oriented scripting language</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. With JavaScript, you can make a webpage respond to user actions, like clicking buttons or entering information, and update content without needing to refresh
                the whole page.
                <p> It's used to create things like pop-up messages, interactive forms, and animations on webpages.</p>
            </p> It's a fundamental technology for modern web development and adds life and functionality to websites.</p>

                    <p>They can be re-declared within the same scope without any error.</p>

                <p>avaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language used for web development. It is embedded in web browsers and is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. JavaScript allows you to add behavior and interactivity to web applications.</p>
                <p>JavaScript code is executed by web browsers and can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages. It runs in a browser's sandboxed environment.</p>
                <p>JavaScript uses loosely typed variables and has dynamic data structures like objects and arrays.</p>
                <p>JavaScript has a massive and active community, with numerous libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for various purposes.</p>

                <li> <strong>Java</strong></li>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for various purposes, including web development (Java EE), desktop application development (Java SE), mobile app development (Android), and server-side development (Java Spring).
                    It is known for its platform independence and "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.</p>
                <p>Java has a more strict and statically-typed syntax. Variable types must be declared explicitly, and type checking is done at compile-time.</p>
                <p>Java applications are compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java can run on various platforms as long as there is a compatible JVM available.</p>

                <p>Java also has a large community and is widely used in enterprise-level applications. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate).</p>
